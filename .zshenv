# This is read first and read every time. This is where you set environment variables.
# I say this is optional because it is geared more toward advanced users where having
# your $PATH, $PAGER, or $EDITOR variables may be important for things like scripts
# that get called by launchd. Those run under a non-interactive shell so anything in
# .zprofile or .zshrc won't get loaded.
