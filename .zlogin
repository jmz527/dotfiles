# .zlogin and .zprofile are basically the same thing - they set the environment
# for login shells; they just get loaded at different times (see below). .zprofile
# is based on the Bash's .bash_profile while .zlogin is a derivative of CSH's .login.
# Since Bash was the default shell for everything up to Mojave, stick with .zprofile.

# echo ".zlogin"
